# Multi-Compartment-Neural-model

## Overview
Multi-compartment models are a powerful tool in computational neuroscience for simulating the electrical properties of neurons in a more detailed and anatomically accurate manner than simpler point-neuron models. They allow for the exploration of how neural structure impacts function, the study of signal propagation along dendrites, and the investigation of complex phenomena such as synaptic integration and plasticity.The notebook contains a comprehensive exploration of multi-compartment modeling in the context of computational neuroscience, with a focus on modeling spatially extended neural structures. 

## Structure
1. Establishing model parameters, such as physical and electrical properties of the cable approximated neuronal structure,essential for calculating the multicompartment response to electrical input, considering the multicompartment model as a cable.
2. Defining the electrical current function
3. The Differential cable Equation and solving it numerically, using forward Euler's method
4. Plotting and analyzing the results

## Conclusion
The notebook guides through the construction and analysis of multi-compartment models, with a strong emphasis on the mathematical and computational aspects. The notebook includes simulations of neural dynamics under different conditions, exploring how electrical signals propagate along neurons or how various parameters affect the neuron's behavior.

Given the mix of theoretical background and practical application, the notebook serves not only as a tutorial for constructing and simulating multi-compartment models but also as a resource for understanding the underlying physics and biology of neural structures.
